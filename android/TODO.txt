- detect services by enumerating packages instead of external command
- make the status line (ie "analyzing...") more prominent.. perhaps using something other than a text view, or by having a divider show up
	-- done, modify the the value of x in <x>dip to make it larger or smaller, or if you know a better way, then do that.  I just found this online ~Amanda
- tweaking and cleaning up analysis (might be better to list all packages and match a few patterns than looking for some specific package names)
- any other analysis tweaks
- any ideas for making the gui more pleasant
- adding more logging to the detection (instead of logging just to the android adb logcat log)
- perhaps submitting the entire log to the server, in case we want to peruse it afterwards
- capturing the result from the POST during reporting and showing that during the toast
