- detect services by enumerating packages instead of external command
- make the status line (ie "analyzing...") more prominent.. perhaps using something other than a text view, or by having a divider show up
	-- done, modify the the value of x in <x>dip to make it larger or smaller and tint to change color, or if you know a better way, then do that.  I just found this online ~Amanda
- tweaking and cleaning up analysis (might be better to list all packages and match a few patterns than looking for some specific package names)
- any other analysis tweaks
- any ideas for making the gui more pleasant
- adding more logging to the detection (instead of logging just to the android adb logcat log)
- perhaps submitting the entire log to the server, in case we want to peruse it afterwards
- capturing the result from the POST during reporting and showing that during the toast
- figure out why Amanda's test phone has all tests returning 0, from the logcat it appears it is finding the things so perhaps it's just an issue with how information is being displayed in the log?
